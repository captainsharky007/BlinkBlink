              <h2 id="4-tracking-technologies">4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
              <p>BlinkBlink and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.</p>
              <p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
              <p>
                We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law. We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals.

The Community will also have access to general usage information on an anonymized and aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products.</p>
              <p>Your Community may also have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under applicable law for such sharing. For example, many employers are offering incentive programs based on employee participation in health &amp; wellness programs and desire to better understand how each of their individual employees is using the Products.</p>
